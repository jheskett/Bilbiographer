' MainForm.SearchPanel.vb
' CIS410 Fall 2018 Final Project
' Members: Jeff Heskett, Phillip Foss, Ian Shaw
' Purpose: This project will allow a user to store and retrieve bibliographic references for documents by author or year
'
' This is a Partial class of MainForm and contains the code for the SearchPanel in a separate file. It is not a distinct
' class but merely SearchPanel-related code split from MainForm.vb into a separate file so the code is better organized.
'
' For clarity, do not define any class-wide properties in this file; use the main MainForm for that.

Partial Public Class MainForm
